🧠 NeuraDesk – AI Voice Receptionist System

A real-time AI-powered voice receptionist that handles inbound calls, manages appointments, answers FAQs, and intelligently routes conversations using speech recognition and LLM-based intent processing.

This project demonstrates how modern conversational AI systems can automate front-desk operations efficiently, consistently, and naturally using no-code AI orchestration and ElevenLabs voice synthesis.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional reception systems depend heavily on human availability, making them:

Limited to working hours

Expensive to scale

Inconsistent during high call volumes

NeuraDesk automates the reception workflow by:

Processing real-time voice input

Understanding user intent via LLM reasoning

Executing structured business logic

Responding with natural human-like voice output

The system delivers intelligent, automated front-desk communication without rigid scripted flows.

🧠 How NeuraDesk Works
1️⃣ Voice Input Processing

User initiates a call

Speech-to-text engine converts voice into text

Conversation context is maintained

2️⃣ Intent Detection & Entity Extraction

Using LLM-based reasoning, the system:

Identifies user intent (booking, inquiry, routing, etc.)

Extracts relevant details (name, date, time, purpose)

Determines next conversational step

3️⃣ Business Logic Execution

Based on detected intent, the system:

Validates appointment availability

Retrieves FAQ responses

Routes calls to appropriate departments

Manages conversation state

4️⃣ Response Generation & Voice Output

AI generates contextual response text

ElevenLabs converts text into natural speech

Caller receives human-like voice reply
